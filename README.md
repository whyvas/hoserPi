# hoserPi
Yet another Raspberry Pi gardening system. The goal of this project is to setup 5 independent zones in elevated beds. Each bed will have a soil moisture sensor and a solenoid controlled watering system. The system will run on python and the webioPi framework. Instead of hooking the system up to the water main, I will be using a 30 gallon barrel with a low water switch as I am scared of flooding my yard should something go wrong.

Upcoming Features:

-5 zone soil moisture monitoring w/ automatic watering

-Temperature sensor

-Humidity sensor

-Barometric pressure sensor

-5 zone Sunlight sensors (my garden is in a covered area)

-Low water sensor

-SQL logging of all sensor data every 15 minutes to local NAS

-Timelapse photography with video rendering

-Error detection (invalid values, watering issues)

-Web based remote monitoring and control
